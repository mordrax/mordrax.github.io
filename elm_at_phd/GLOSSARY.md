## TEA
The Elm Architecture. In 0.17, it was common and recommended to nest modules and wire up their init/update/view to each parent. I call these TEA modules.

## Alfred
The _helpful_ butler who knows a bunch of useful FP things, so named to avoid namespace conflicts with other popular modules that uses Helper as a top level module name.

## Lookup
A repository of static domain data such as enums, insurance products, users etc... Lookup is useful for displaying string representations of ids.

## FUN!
A reference to Dwarf Fortress where 'losing is fun'. Much in a similar vein, extensible records can get very confusing very quickly.
